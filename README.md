# PathUtilities
Just made this quick module because it got annoying to constantly update paths and deal with bad MSI's duplicating paths and so on. Feel free to use and add something if it needs anything. It works for my needs.

## How to import module 
```Import-Module 'C:\Users\Tony\YourScripts\Modules\PathUtilities\PathUtilities.psd1'``` 
To permanately import just add that command to your ```$Profile```.
